# 714ReFi
714ReFi is building a decentralized platform that bridges real-world entrepreneurship with blockchain transparency.

Our mission is to regenerate economies starting from agriculture and transport sectors — empowering local farmers, small-scale transporters, and food entrepreneurs through easy-access, community-governed funding.

Unlike traditional finance models that trap entrepreneurs with debt and bureaucracy, 714ReFi provides transparent, Shariah-compliant, regenerative funding pools — driven by a community-first spirit.

714ReFi's first focus areas:

Rice farming (high food demand, profitable and scalable).

Transport empowerment (funding tricycles and small logistics solutions).

Poultry and Fish farming (essential food sectors).


Platform Users:

Farmers, transporters, and entrepreneurs seeking funding.

Crypto investors seeking real-world impact and fair returns.

Communities voting and supporting regenerative projects.




> Utility:
714ReFi introduces a native token, used for governance voting, funding pools participation, and community rewards.
30% of initial supply will be distributed to early believers from the CZ FAN TOKEN community, building a bridge between meme culture energy and real-world regenerative action.
